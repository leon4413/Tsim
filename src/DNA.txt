DNA is an array for the live_object class.
array lenght: 9


0 - DNA_deviancy : 
how much the DNA array changes every reproduction cycle

## caps

1 - energy_cap :
how much energy can the entity contain

2 - food_cap :
how much food can the entity contain

3 - water_cap :
how much water can the entity contain

## uses

4 - energy_use :
how quickly does the entity use energy (and heat itself)

5 - food_use :
how quickly does the entity transform food in energy 

6 - water_use :
?? needs side effect ??

## misc

7 - reproduciton rate :
